# Why Badlion is Bad

</div>

## A disclaimer

- This is not an excuse to hate on users of Badlion. This is so people are aware and then make a decision on whether or not they should use Badlion or not.

- Bias will almost definetly be here. If you want to make this somewhat less biased, make a PR.

- As said in the second bullet point, if you want to contribute to this, make a PR.


## Content creators
Content creators that are "sponsored" by Badlion get less than 70% of the money earnt from their cosmetic and even less if the people buying it do not use their code. See [Bedless quits Badlion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbYUvejjPkA/) (at one point cxlvxn talked about it but the twitter account got suspended).

## Pedophilia
The owners are known to show pedophilic actions. See [MasterGBerry exposed](https://badlion.xyz/) and [ArchyBot exposed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDlDUmVxkGI/). **AS OF RECENTLY BOTH OWNERS EXPOSED FOR PEDOPHILIA HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THE TEAM!**

## Bugs
The client is known to have many bugs. See [Badlion Bug Report Forums](https://www.badlion.net/forum/category/4).

## No credits given
Many mods have been from popular forge mods and do not give any attribution and never ask the original creator (s) beforehand. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45589059/115368249-1bc4ba80-a1f1-11eb-8abc-c87c4d7c3868.png) ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45589059/115368328-2c753080-a1f1-11eb-8a28-e8d77561e6e0.png)



## Harbouring more pedophiles
At least 2 of the content creators that had cosmetics in Badlion were pedophiles . These are Tenebrous (the old owner of the channel, not the current one) and DeHamad (who is currently hiding as an Arabic BlocksMC YouTuber)

## Cosmetics do not fit the feel of Minecraft
Instead of Minecraft's blocky feel, most of Badlion's cosmetics look too modern and smooth to be in Minecraft.

## HUD is uncentered
All of their HUD elements are uncentered. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45589059/115368651-7e1dbb00-a1f1-11eb-909a-8e4d8556a4ba.png)

## Cluttered and unorganized
The GUI and HUD of Badlion is cluttered, due to the poor organization of mods.

## FPS
Badlion is known to have less FPS than Lunar in most cases.
